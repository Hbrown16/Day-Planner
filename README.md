# Day-Planner

[Deployable Link]()

## Your Task
The Day Planner was created to display a easy to you calender application where we can show previous skills with HTML/CSS as well as utilize Jquery. The task was to create a display that would show an array of hours throughout the day that could connect with the actual time of day that you could add and save and revisit what you have inputed.

I found this to be a great assignment to show off my HTML/CSS skills with my new found knowledge of JQuery and how they work together. You can see when you visit the application, current time is highlighted in _____, past hours are greyed out as you can no longer add events and then future hours are available high lighted in green.

## Acceptance Criteria
